During a stormy summer in 1992, <A HREF="mailto:Herbert.VandeSompel@rug.ac.be"><B>Herbert Van de Sompel</B></A> and <A HREF="mailto:Guy.VanBelle@rug.ac.be"><B>Guy c. Jules Van Belle</B></A> stash their gear together in a backroom, and pick up a slogan from a blurry clip in the late news. Within a couple of weeks they finish <B>The Newspaper Sessions</B>, a comprehensive series of pieces for computers and sound generators. <BR>In the performances they got assisted by two American vocalists on top of some trashy B&W television sets. Themes range from euthanasia, social-technological problems, to religion and transsexuality, and are all unconditionally mediatised.

For the subsequent performances, a gradual transformation and integration of all elements occurs: more computers are added to the network, each with a distinctive creative task. Images are digitally generated and modified. Computer voices simulate the human dialogues. <BR>Finally, also the music proves to be different: the original thumbnail-themes played by 'instruments that can have a name' are transformed into hefty sequences constituted by detached sounds. This develops further into a new collection, <B>The Neckhair Chronicles</B>. The fragmented texts suggest characters and players who only exist in the musical lines with an indefinite story tracing the sneaky zone between new theories and charlatanism.<P>

Flanders has always been proud of the support to a its traditional music culture, denying progressive tendencies. This is conform to an international consciousness, of course. <BR>Douglas Kahn: <CITE>"The lateness of Cage's modernism is in direct relation to the conservatism of Western art music"</CITE>. <BR>On the other side, Young Farmers have never been too troublesome: aside from a classical and avant-garde background, they frequently hint at the more popular genres: ethnical music, underground, hiphop and experimental pop.<P> 
<P>
By the end of 1994, they complete most of the studiowork at <A HREF="http://www.dds.nl/~steim"><B>STEIM</B></A> (Amsterdam), and go into post-production at their own studio .ping. The music is ready for release. <BR>A whimsical remark: "Quick, before the medium changes ...", and Young Farmers are already editing their archive on Internet for inclusion on the CD.<BR>  (<DFN><A HREF="http://www.riv.net/heatwave/garage/farmers/tex/default.html">@RIVERLAND</A>)</DFN><BR>
A huge digital poster uses the computer monitor as a viewmaster. Again, such a move is always bothersome, and the question arises: will <B>Young Farmers Claim Future</B> produce 'last of the mixed-mode CD's' or 'first of the CD+'?"<BR> <B>Kick Dicky's ass and find out for yourself. </B>

PS By <B>SUB ROSA</B>, October 2  1995: 
<BR>"...consider too that of course it will be not so easy to sell it 
<BR>because it is not immediate pop music, <BR>
so don't expect to be like Mick Jagger in the next 6 months..."
