Jamming with their computer keyboards and mice, they composed the Newspaper Sessions' music in no time.

<p>After a while, <a href="../pix/b-markest.jpeg">Markest Tate</a> joined the duo as a talking head.  Meanwhile, <a href="../pix/b-asbach.jpeg">Asbach 1920</a> was hiding from the sun somewhere in the Los Angeles area and so the Farmers sent her a tape by Federal Express, hoping that she would start rehearsing the lyrics on her own.  The Farmers arranged for <a href="../pix/b-logo.jpeg">T-Shirts, leaflets and posters</a> to support their re-introduction into the Flemish arty society.  Asbach 1920 flew over from the States and proved unable to overcome her jetlag.

<p>Everyone was there - that first night - when Guy and Herbert installed the panicking Asbach and Markest on stage and hid themselves and their computers in a backroom.  The video-cameras, mounted on top of the machines, captured their <a href="../pix/b-news1.jpeg">facial expressions in close-up</a>.  The images were sent to old <b>black & white</b> televisions standing on top of the <a href="../pix/b-news2.jpeg">2 by 2 meter stage</a>, where Robin and Markest were trying not to show the audience they were reading the lyrics from sheets.

<p>The performance turned out to be a gigantic success.  The Farmers were very pleased with the result of their real-time computer-based composition tools that failed to crash during the gig.  The <i>befriended</i> artists in the audience were relieved, because - aware of the politics of Belgian Art Centers - they knew this band could hardly be any competition to them.  The manager of <b>The Green Frog</b> was pleased because at last his bar had become what he had always wanted it to be: an ordinary Bier&szlig;tube.

<p>Note: most people in the audience had not understood that the Farmers had been playing live from the backroom.  They thought it had all been taped.  Remote performances - from 10 meters away in this case - are not a hot topic in Belgium.  Moreover:
