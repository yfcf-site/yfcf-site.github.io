<p>Barbara grew up as an apparantly normal girl,<p>
enjoying a happy childhood.<p>
As her teenage years approached, <p>
she looked forward to experiencing <p>
the same sexual development she saw in other girls.<p>
<p>
Gradually, however, she began to have a vague sense<p>
that the expected changes weren't happening in her.<p>
By the age of 14 she was really worried:<p>
she had not yet menstruated,<p>
and her breasts showed no signs of growth.<p>
What she did have was a pain in her left groin<p>
that eventually subsided,<p>
only to be replaced by the appearance of a mass<p>
in the left side of her labia.<p>
With growing shock, she felt her voice dropping,<p>
facial hair growing, and her clitoris enlarging<p>
to become more and more like É<p>
É a penis.<p>
<p>
After Barbara's sixtheenth birthday,<p>
her penis developped erections, <p>
she produced ejaculations,<p>
and she found herself feeling a sexual interest in girls.<p>
<p>
By now she had become convinced that she really was<p>
a boy.<p>
