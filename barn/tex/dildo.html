<p>Dildo's, what are you talking about?  
<p>A dildo is an artificial penis
<p>and an artificial penis, according to the Dutch dictionary
<p>Van Dale, eleventh edition, is a penis which is made of
<p>artificial material, used to replace a real one, 
<p>more specifically for masturbation. 
<p>
<p>Dildo came to Dutch 
<p>through American English. 
<p>Until recently, etymologists ignored
<p>any explanation for its origin. 
<p>But a professor in Arabic from Utrecht
<p>and one from New York
<p>started a hypothesis
<p>which shows the Arabic doeldoel for donkey
<p>as the origin of dildo. 
<p>
<p>According to the hypothesis 
<p>English learned the dildo from the Spanish, 
<p>who took the word from Arabic. 
<p>Doeldoel means something that dangles, 
<p>something swinging. 
<p>
<p>According to a Spanish encyclopaedia, on the other hand, 
<p>a dildo was a cactus with a soft but strong trunk
<p>and pricks standing upright. 
<p>
<p>Thomas Nash wrote in 1601
<p>'The Merry Ballad of Nash his Dildo'
<p>in which a poet meets his mistress in a brothel, 
<p>after which he is suddenly overcome
<p>by acute impotence. 
<p>
<p><blockquote>My little dildo shall supply your kind. 
<p>A youth that is as light as leaves in wind:
<p>He bendeth not, nor foldeth any deal, 
<p>But stands as stiff as he were made of steel.</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Some see the origin of dildo
<p>in the Italian diletto, delight, 
<p>but according to others, the English word derived
<p>via diddle-o from to diddle, 
<p>that has a lot of significations
<p>like to tease and to masturbate. 
<p>
<p>The dildo as a comforter for the lower body regions. 
<p>In France the object was called
<p>godemichi. 
<p>
<p>And Jeroen Jeroense in 1698 :
<p>The ladies who get no sausage to their toaster, 
<p>help themselves more than once with a velvet soother, 
<p>but Giest, and Trijn, and Hagt, and Griet, 
<p>do it together with a beet. 
<p>
<p>sausage=penis, toaster=vagina, 
<p>soother=dildo. 
<p>
<p>Finally, every now and then and
<p>like a phantom out of the haze of history
<p>appears the doubledildo !
<p>but I don't know anything specific about it.
