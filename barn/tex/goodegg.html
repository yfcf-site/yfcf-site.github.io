<p>What beautiful gloves!
<p>Do you like them? Take them, they're yours.
<p>And just what, may I ask, would I do with them?
<p>You can keep them as a souvenir of our first meeting.</a>


<h2>narrator: Space, the forbidden subjects</h2>

There are worlds, frontiers, borders, boundaries, barriers. 
Take for instance the Trojan Horse. Of course. Looks can be deceiving. When we leave the earth and travel into space in lets say for instance a spacecraft what is the difference in thinking time spent in space on earth or time spent thinking about space on earth that is to say the space above us (not the space around us) or vice-versa which would mean we would be thinking about earth space while in the spacecraft. 
Yes, it is really very interesting. 
Take for instance a cat stuck in a tree. How does this model apply to the cat. Is the cat  thinking about his food dish which lies in the kitchen while he is in the tree or might he even be contemplating a climb while passing the tree on his way to the dish? 
Lets look at history. The Three Musketeers are certainly a brilliant example of swinging, riding, drinking, fencing and leaping. What were they thinking? It is clear that we cannot go back to this time but if we can look through time to see another time are we not thinking about time differently as one might think about the ground verses the sky? 
Waking up going to sleep- it's all part of it. 
I once knew a physicist who said if you reach out at the right moment you can put your hand through the wall. Do you believe that? Does it also mean that at the right moment you can put your head through the wall? (I think I did this once) 
I was at a birthday party and the cake was in the shape of a ship that is a sailing ship not a spaceship and I couldn't help but think that ships are for sailing, voyaging, travelling, rowing, blowing but not for being born. 
It should have been an egg.<p>


<h2>v1 [bprofessor]: The Obsession</h2>

<ul>
<h3>friday 10:30PM</h3>
When I enter I look for you although trying hard not to let it show. Can you read me. I know I shouldn't have invited you to that party. Still the way you were feeling my leather gloves- it gave me a certain confidence.<p>

<h3>sunday 1PM</h3>
You hang around by the phone then leave. I am dropping all the obvious hints. You only react occasionally but it's enough for me. Did we meet each other in a past life or is this life the one where we are supposed to meet. How do you like your eggs cooked. When I put them on the table your expression is strange. Is this obsession founded in something else....<p>

<h3>sunday 11PM </h3>
I follow the events of the evening as one would read the signs on the highway. Where are we driving. Again more eggs.  There is something strange about you. Being just a boy you don't know how to cover it up. Then again- you don't need to.  <p>

<H3>tuesday Midnight</h3>
I can feel a (desire)(cold)(crazy) level of excitement. You give me a gift -you are like my little brother. I know where I am going. Not to get that beer you always get but tonight I can see it is more than that. Of course it is always more for me. Still the gloves, the egg, every night a little trinket. Why do you ask me what train I'm taking? Is it because you want me to leave?
I can only be left lying here in my room wondering what kind of agile body lies beneath that black suit. <p>

<h3>wednesday 3PM</h3>
Under the bleachers we changed our clothes. I could see you are not my little brother after all. Picnic with hard-boiled eggs. I wonder why you don't use salt. Could it be something physical. I think about tomorrow's appointment. 
later
If you could read my thoughts for ten minutes what then ?<p>

<h2>v2 [Mina's dream]: The Castle</h2>

I left my husband in Paris and went by train to a castle in the Black Forest. 
It was raining heavily on the day of my arrival and I confined myself to my room to write letters, occasionally looking out the window over the garden. Something was moving there in the forest. I made a note to ask the hostess what kind of animals they have in these parts. 
Upon my coming the castle the entry-hall was crowded with men in black suits carrying strange equipment. Thinking of this scene now I was reminded of my father who for years attended scientific conferences about materials which had the ability to move and think by themselves. 
He also wore black. 
On my 11th birthday he was travelling on business to  Switzerland where he was hit by a tram and killed instantly. 
Again there was a rustling in the bushes below my window. 
Having lost my concentration to write I decided to go for a walk. 
When I entered the great hall a bell was ringing. 
It was time for dinner. 
The hostess who was dressed in black led me into a stone room with a high vaulted ceiling and a large indoor swimming pool taking up most of the floor space. Floating in the pool was a buoyant silver tray holding five white candles burning in the shape of a 'V'.  At the far end of the room was a long table set in a formal way with several dishes of steaming yellow food. Upon closer inspection I noticed that these dishes, although differently spiced, consisted only of eggs. Despite this strange detail the meal was elaborately appointed, just what one might expect to find when dinning in a castle. 
The first guests arrived and were seated. Although the large group of men had arrived today I notice the table was only set for four persons. I was assigned a chair by the hostess which was markedly different from the others,  modern in style rather than of the Renaissance period which was consistent in the decor throughout The Castle, even in the place-settings. 
(I found this fact disturbing-why did I receive this chair?) 
Just at that moment I noticed there was something large and dark at the bottom of the swimming pool. As I stood up it began to move toward the surface, swimming in my direction. 
I wanted to excuse myself from the table but the hostess made it clear by her expression that I was not allowed to leave. I sat down again with my back to the water. I tried to ignore this situation as best I could and continued my meal in silence. The others chatted idly among themselves in German. 
After a while I could hear something splashing directly behind my chair. When I began to turn around the hostess laid a hand on my arm. 
"Don't look back," she said.  <p>


<h2>choir 2: Sally's accident</h2>

Sally turned on the overhead light in the bathroom and began to remove her clothes. 
Outside the wind was rising. 
As she undressed she thought about the love scene in the movie she had gone to see with her boyfriend. She looked at her stomach in the mirror. 
The hot water tap was leaking again. 
After her shower she went into the kitchen to find a wrench. 
When she saw her neighbour in the kitchen window, she hid behind the door. 
Sally turned on the overhead light in the bathroom and began to remove her clothes. 
It was a stormy night. 
As she undressed she thought about warm countries where people didn't need to wear shoes. 
Getting into the shower she could feel a cold breeze coming under the door. 
After turning off the hot water tap she went into the kitchen to close the window. When she saw her neighbour in the kitchen window holding a wrench
she turned on the light.   
Sally turned on the overhead light in the bathroom and began to remove her clothes. 
When she stepped into the shower she heard noises coming from the kitchen. After turning off the hot water tap she stood by the door and listened. <p>

Getting out of the shower she could feel a cold breeze across her neck. She picked up a wrench from under the sink and went into the kitchen. 
When she turned on the light she realised 
it was probably just her neighbour.
Sally turned on the overhead light in the bathroom and began to remove her clothes. 
Outside the wind was rising. 
As she showered she thought about a movie where a woman was murdered in her kitchen with a wrench. 
The shower was too hot. After fixing the hot water tap she went into the kitchen to close the blinds. 
When she turned out the light
she saw her neighbour standing in the window.
Sally turned on the overhead light in the bathroom and began to remove her clothes. 
When she reached her socks she hesitated 
because her feet were cold. 
Outside the wind was rising. 
She turned on the small space heater and got into the shower. 
When she smelled the soap she thought about the last time she made love to her boyfriend. Turning off the hot water tap she stood by the door and listened. 
There were noises coming from the kitchen.  
When she saw her neighbour standing in the window
she turned out the light.  <p>
