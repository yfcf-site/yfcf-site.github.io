<p>Flanders, Winter 1993

<h2>The Onscherpte Exhibition</h2>

<p>In December 1993, Young Farmers Claim Future were asked to participate in the <b>Onscherpte</b> festival in Ghent, Belgium.  In this private art project by <a href="../pix/b-thomas.jpeg">photographer Thomas Mistiaen</a>, several Belgian artists and philosophers were asked for a contribution, either for the exhibition or for the catalog. Young Farmers Claim Future contributed with a performance.

The dissatisfaction with the local cultural infrastructure, and with a narrow and unproductive vision on collaboration by the external artists prompted the decision to skip most of the wetware actions and transfer everything to the computer.

The necessary adjustments were made and the character of the software performers was altered to be consistent with the music and images.

This changed the structure fundamentally, because this operation united 3 distinct units into one major show, with overlapping and independent threads.

<h2>The Meaning Of <i>Onscherpte</i>
<p><a href="../pix/b-claemit4.jpeg"><img align=top src="../pix/s-claemit4.gif"></a>
</h2>

<p>According to the catalog, the meaning of <i>Onscherpte</i> refers to 2 different ideas: vagueness and disturbance. The assemblage technique used by Young Farmers Claim Future enacts this to a certain extent. On the one hand, the origin of the found material has been masked by the use of rough newsreel from

Moreover, the audiences' perception is disturbed in two ways.  First of all, the replacement of human sound sources by real-time computer speech generates uncertainty about physical presence.  Secondly, the use of the

   data-versiondate="19950101"

<p>To the Farmers <i>Onscherpte</i> also reflects the position of new art forms, as well as the position of the people involved in the creation and exhibition of these forms. The role of technology, persistently used for creative purposes, is a very important factor in the evaluation by the audience in general and the traditional media representatives specifically. The response gets blurred by social and emotional values all the time, to the point that it may block the perception of the beauty of a digital piece of art on the grounds of the chosen media. This obscures most of the discussion and critique nowadays. 

<p><blockquote>Digital Art Is A Life Form, Not A Quality. (YFCF, 1993)</blockquote>

<p>Note: The performance name <B>Claem It</b> has a story to it. Due to a spelling error by the organizers of the event, the posters mentioned Young Farmers Claem Future (sic). Since the Farmers always had to claim their position as artists themselves, they abused the misspelling as a form of self-critique. <b>ClaemIt</b> looked like a good name for a folk band.
