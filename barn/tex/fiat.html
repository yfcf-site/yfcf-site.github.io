<p>A british two years-old girl died
<p>when she put the electric window of her father's car
<p>unintentionally into operation 
<p>
<p>She put her head out of the window
<p>and choked when that window, 
<p>that was operated electrically, 
<p>closed. 
<p>
<p>She couldn't be saved and died
<p>while she was being transported to a hospital
<p>in Cobham in Surrey. 
<p>
<p>Douglas Richardson
<p>the father saw that his daughter
<p>Lucinda
<p>was choking, 
<p>but he arrived to late. 
<p>
<p>Fiat showed its sympathy, 
<p>(in the dutch text, there is compassion)
<p>but doesn't know how to explain 
<p>that the accident could happen
<p>
<p>It happened on a Sunday. 
<p>
<p>To close an electrically operated window from the front side
<p>without the presence of an ignition key, 
<p>one of the front doors 
<p>must have been opened
<p>while the button was pushed down all the time. 
<p>
<p>Fiat intends
<p>to prevent the opening and closing of the window 
<p>in one go, 
<p>and wants to change it to small jolts
<p>and with different pushes on the button.
