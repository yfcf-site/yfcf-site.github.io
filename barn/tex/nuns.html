<p>The religious are more frequently ill than their counterparts
<p>in ordinary life. 
<p>When comparing the state of health
<p>of 200 nuns
<p>with those of women of the same age, 
<p>researchers of the university of Murcia
<p>in Spain reach the same conclusion. 
<p>
<p>More than half of the nuns were too heavy in weight. 
<p>One third complained of a high blood pressure
<p>and too much cholesterol. 
<p>15 percent proved to have a deviant
<p>electrocardiogram reading. 
<p>
<p>They don't smoke, 
<p>neither do they drink alcohol, 
<p>and only one third regularly drinks
<p>coffee
<p>
<p>They eat a lot of chicken, 
<p>but few eggs. 
<p>The meat is roasted or fried 
<p>in vegetal fat. 
<p>
<p>They are celibate,  
<p>They prey. 
<p>They kneel. 
<p>They sit most of the time. 
<p>
<p>That makes them fat
<p>and gives them a higher risk 
<p>for heart and vascular diseases. 
<p>In addition to that
<p>they suffer from stress. 
<p>
<p>Possibly they are worried about things
<p>that we cannot know.
