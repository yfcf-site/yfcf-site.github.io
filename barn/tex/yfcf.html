<p>
Welcome to the barn of Young Farmers Claim Future, a Belgian-based electronic art duo.  Please be our guest, and explore this Web archive containing an overview of our digital oeuvre: <a href="../tex/audio.html">audio</a>, <a href="../tex/video.html">video</a>, <a href="../tex/perfo.html">performances</a>, <a href="../tex/lyric.html">lyrics</a>, <a href="../tex/max.html">programming</a> and <a href="../tex/work.html">work in progress</a>.  You might want to read an <a href="../tex/yfcfprom.html">introduction</a> to the Farmers' activities first.<p>


<h2>Net Diving &amp; Stage Surfing</h2>

<p>This barn offers a virtual stage to Young Farmers Claim Future for presenting their activities.  We escape a claustrophobic local situation by bringing this information on the Net. Our work was made on computers and now it can be seen all over the world ... on computers and most of the time for free! And we don't have to explain why we don't use musical instruments for the music, people for the singing, and Dutch for the words. And there is no organizer telling us what we should do. 

<p>We think the Net provides the ideal environment for our work to be seen. We always had trouble providing a good overview of what we were doing. People had to visit our studio (small but self-supported), or come to a performance, but still they had an incomplete idea when they left. We always have moved into new things, true to our vocation as life-long learners, experimenting with what we found. Also, because we are continuously re-processing our material and adding other ideas, we have trouble showing finished products.  

<p>The Net, dynamical in nature, is an adequate medium for change, expansion, and transformation of the things on display. Since we are creating our work almost exclusively with digital means, using the Net as a virtual stage is the most logical step to take. It is more than the promotion of our activities. To us, this spot is an artwork in itself. It is our collective autobiography, our collected works, and our collaborative workbench, all at the same time. We hope you appreciate it.
