<h2>Beta than Pong</h2>

The Farmers are currently creating a new performance set-up.  It is built around the BigEye software that Young Farmers are beta-testing.  A library of <a href="../tex/max.html"

In the new set-up, the Farmers use an old Pong TV-game (for you youngsters: the first video game ever) as an interface for computer composition controlling sound, graphics and movies (loop

Pong becomes a musical and visual game, assigning sounds and images to each of the two players involved.  These sounds and images compete to get control over the playground.  When a player takes the lead in the game, his sounds are played more often, and his images and movies will appear more frequently. The looser's sounds become more distorted, ...<p>

The BigEye software, developed by <b>Steim</b> in Amsterdam, is a tool for translating video information into computer-events.  Video input is digitized and the computer tracks the movements of selected objects in real-time.  The Farmers use the Pong puck movement and other game parameters to generate sounds, display images, play movies, ...

<h2><img align=middle src="../pix/s-trout.gif">Genetic Sound Breeding</h2>

<p>Editing sound generators can be a dull and time-consuming job, even with the

   data-versiondate="19950101"
   data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/19970715180039/http://dewey.rug.ac.be/barn/tex/max.html 19970715180039">editors</a> Young Farmers programmed for this purpose.  A large amount of interdependent parameters is involved and a small perturbation in one parameter can cause a tremendous change in the color of the edited sound (this definitely sounds like chaos).   As a matter of fact, the editing of such a sound generating machine can be seen as the optimization of a complex multi-parameter problem where <b>optimal</b> means <b>this sounds great to the composer</b>.  

<p>Until recently the optimization of complex multi-parameter problems was handled using calculus-based, enumerative, and random search methods.  In some cases these methods do not yield the desired results.  Research suggests the need for optimization techniques based on the genetic notion of the <b>survival of the fittest</b>.  The resulting techniques are referred to as <b>genetic algorithms</b>.  

<p>In genetic algorithms, the parameter set of the complex multi-parameter problem is encoded as a string (genes).  Solving the problem starts with the selection of a population of strings (parameters are accorded values).  This population can breed a new generation, exchanging string information (crossover).  Some mutations can take place during this breeding process.  The society thus obtained is set to breed a next generation.  From now on, only those strings containing the most optimal information for the problem to be solved (fittest), are allowed to reproduce.  Repeating this simple technique for some generations can yield optimal solutions.

<p>This is the technique Young Farmers wish to use, in order to create new sounds for their sound generators.  While drinking a nice cup of black coffee, the Farmers will allow their sound-parameter-strings to blind-date in a cosy digital environment.  From time to time the Farmers will peep at the intimate activities and allow only the hottest sounds to breed for a new generation.

<h2>The Gossip Plot</h2>

One of the most intriguing projects Young Farmers hope to realize is <b>The gossip plot</b>.  This would be an interactive QuickTime movie, introducing different actors arguing and gossiping among each other.  An abstract plot, based on evolutionary mechanisms covered by dialogue theory, would be filled out with sound- and movietracks from underlying databases, according to the actual value of parameters such as position in the dialog-line, actual protagonist, actual antagonist, topic, style, user-interaction by (dis)approval of the ongoing conversation,...  The overall style could  be something like the Farmers' preferred soap The <b>Bold</b> and the Beautiful.

<p>The following article in Leonardo (Vol. 26, Number 4, 1993) covering the realisation of a digital micromovie, proved to be enlightening:

<blockquote>Orchestrating Digital Micromovies (Glorianna Davenport, Ryan Evans, Mark Halliday  from MIT's Media Lab)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Dynamics of Dialogue (1990, Ivana Markova and Klaus Foppa)</blockquote>

Young Farmers Claim Future recycled some of the material composed between 1992 and 1994.  They to released a CD called 'Unploughed' on Sub Rosa.  Anybody interested? You can click <A HREF="../../YFCF/UnploughCD.html">here</A> to get a cyber add.
