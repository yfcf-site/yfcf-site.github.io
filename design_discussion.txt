THE BARN
========

* Overall question: Leave the site "as is" with Mementos retrieved from IA or enhance?
- note that it is to a degree already enhanced because published at different URLs
=> SYNTAX/LAYOUT
- correction of obvious layout errors, see e.g. https://youngfarmersclaimfuture.info/barn/tex/cv.html
- addition of HTML tags (current files don't even have an HTML declaration)?
- enforce screen width (container), e.g. for rendering on handhelds? The size of hr images and lack of <p> ahead of images following those, suggest resolution of screen intended was 864 × 480p.
=> PROVENANCE
- visible/invisible comments to indicate changes made?
- banner that indicates resurrected status?
- Robust Links annotations?
=> USABILITY
- migration of existing files to current formats?
- operational Robust Links via JavaScript injection?
- strangely enough the site does not have an affordance to go to the "home" page. Could turn hr images into "take me home".

* audio files not archived. Linked mainly from audio.html.
- Are they on the CDPlus? If yes, require migration?
- If no, how to handle?

* Many links to external pages are 404, e.g. https://youngfarmersclaimfuture.info/barn/tex/sputnick.html . For many no Mementos exist.
- how to handle?
- Robust Links annotations?

* email addresses are obviously outdated because @rug.ac.be

* The resurrected site has several interesting cases for the application of the Robust Links approach:

=> Link to HTML page on the resurrected site e.g. https://youngfarmersclaimfuture.info/barn/tex/cv.html:
- href: https://youngfarmersclaimfuture.info/barn/tex/cv.html
- data-originalurl: http://dewey.rug.ac.be/barn/tex/cv.html
- data-versionurl: https://web.archive.org/web/19990428113621im_/http://dewey.rug.ac.be/barn/tex/cv.html
- data-versiondate: 19990428

=> Link to migrated media on the resurrected site e.g. https://youngfarmersclaimfuture.info/barn/quix/f-winterwalk.mp4:
- href: https://youngfarmersclaimfuture.info/barn/quix/f-winterwalk.mp4
- data-originalurl: http://dewey.rug.ac.be/barn/quix/f-winterwalk.mov
- data-versionurl: https://web.archive.org/web/19970715192225im_/http://dewey.rug.ac.be/barn/quix/f-winterwalk.mov
- data-versiondate: 19990428

=> Link to external page with Memento e.g. http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music.html:
- href: http://web.archive.org/web/19961019180127/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music.html
- data-originalurl: http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music.html
- data-versionurl: http://web.archive.org/web/19961019180127/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music.html
- data-versiondate: 19950509

=> Link to external page with Memento e.g. http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music.html:
- href: https://web.archive.org/web/19981205170619/http://www.music.indiana.edu/misc/music_resources.html

- data-versionurl: https://web.archive.org/web/19981205170619/http://www.music.indiana.edu/misc/music_resources.html
- data-versiondate: 19950509

=> Link to external page without Memento, e.g. http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Music/:
